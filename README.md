# ConnectFourTest
This is a test project based on the popular game Connect4. It follows the same rules and you compete against a CPU.
## Content
It has a Title Screen, some classes for sounds, custom functionality for buttons and a external plugin for tweens. 
Almost all the functionality of the game is on the class 'GameManager.cs', it basically checks the position of all the pieces placed on the board
to check if there is a win combination, the AI also check the pieces per row and the last move of the player so it can prevents the player from winning or make the last move to win.
## Important Note
All the classes used on this project were created by me except fot the external plugin, I tried to make the scripts as simple as possible(variable names, and function names), also I 
added some notes but it should be clear enough to any Unity Developer.
